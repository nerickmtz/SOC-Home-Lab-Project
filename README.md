# SOC Home Lab Project (Work in Progress)

This repository documents my ongoing project to build and experiment with a **Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab**. The lab is designed to provide hands-on experience in monitoring, logging, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity threats using real-world SOC tools and techniques.

> **Note**: This project is still in development, and I'm actively learning and experimenting with different configurations. IP addresses and other sensitive details will not be documented until the project is finalized.

## Lab Overview

The lab is hosted on a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** provided by Vultr. It includes several key servers and components that work together to mimic a realistic enterprise environment. The purpose of this project is to gain practical knowledge in monitoring, threat detection, and incident response using commonly used SOC tools like Elastic Stack and OS Ticket.

### Lab Components

1. **SOC Analyst Laptop**:
   - The SOC analyst laptop is used to access the **Elastic & Kibana** server via a web interface. Here, the analyst ( me ) can monitor the logs, search for security issues, and view alerts.
   
2. **Attack Laptop (Kali Linux)**:
   - This laptop is used to simulate an attacker. Using **Kali Linux** and a **C2 Server (Mythic)**, different attack scenarios are tested to see how well the monitoring systems detect malicious activity.

3. **Elastic & Kibana**:
   - Elastic is responsible for collecting logs from various servers. Kibana is the user interface used to search, visualize, and create alerts based on these logs.

4. **Fleet Server**:
   - The Fleet Server manages the agents running on the Windows and Ubuntu servers. These agents are responsible for forwarding logs from those systems to Elastic for analysis.

5. **Windows Server (RDP Enabled)**:
   - This server simulates a corporate Windows environment with **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** enabled. It generates logs that are monitored by Elastic for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts.

6. **Ubuntu Server (SSH Enabled)**:
   - A Linux environment with **SSH** enabled. This server is also monitored for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized SSH access attempts.

7. **OS Ticket Server**:
   - OS Ticket is used to manage and track incidents. Alerts generated by Elastic are sent to OS Ticket, creating tickets that the SOC analyst can investigate and respond to.

### Lab Architecture Diagram

Below is the architecture diagram that shows how the components interact in the SOC home lab.

### Network Details

- **Private Network**: 172.31.0.0/24
- **IP Range**: 172.31.0.1-254
- **Subnet**: 255.255.255.0

### How It Works

1. **Log Collection**: 
   - Logs from both the Windows and Ubuntu servers are forwarded to the **Fleet Server**, which then sends them to **Elastic & Kibana** for central analysis.
   
2. **Alerting**: 
   - When suspicious activity is detected, **Elastic** generates alerts. These alerts are sent to **OS Ticket**, where tickets are created for further investigation.

3. **Simulating Attacks**:
   - The **Attack Laptop** (Kali Linux) is used to simulate real-world attacks, such as RDP brute force attempts or SSH attacks. This provides an opportunity to see how the SOC tools detect and respond to such attacks.

### Key Objectives

- Learn how to use **Elastic & Kibana** for log analysis and monitoring.
- Set up and manage agents with **Fleet**.
- Understand how a SOC manages incidents through **OS Ticket**.
- Simulate and detect attacks using **Kali Linux** and **C2 server (Mythic)**.
- Gain experience with the workflow of incident detection and response in a SOC environment.
